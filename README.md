# PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND SKILL OUTLINE

Hi, thanks for taking the time to review my github data analysis portfolio. 

Currently, I have two projects highlighting my coding skills in **Python** and **SQL** as well as my ability to use **Snowflake** and **AWS** for database creation/data  warehousing/staging/storage/pipelining purposes. Finally, I have used **Tableau Public** to visualise data. In future, I aim to tackle NLP machine-learning projects particularly with regards to sentiment analysis of tweets as well as client reviews/suggestions/opinions.

**PREPARATION**

1. The world happiness and fertility rates project is a combination of data sourced from Kaggle (source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness ) and      publicly available UN data These were then imported onto snowflake and prepared for final analysis on Tableau.

2. The Spotify data was collected directly through querying their API via a Python Script. The resulting JSON was then directly sent to AWS kinesis data streams (via the    Python Script) which sent the data through AWS kinesis firehose delivery stream straight to a table in Snowflake via a data pipeline that I had configured in both        these technologies. The next step involved handling raw JSON data and splitting it into meaningful columns before exporting it for analysis onto Tableau.
